# Task5_python
# ðŸš¢ Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#Objective
This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover hidden patterns, relationships, trends, and anomalies.

#Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

#Steps Followed
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Missing Values Analysis and Treatment
3. Univariate Analysis (Histograms, Boxplots)
4. Bivariate Analysis (Countplots, Barplots)
5. Multivariate Analysis (Heatmaps, Pairplots)
6. Extra Visualizations (Pie Charts, Survival Rates)
7. Key Observations
8. Summary and Conclusions

# Visualizations
- Histograms for Age and Fare distribution
- Countplot of Survival by Gender and Class
- Correlation Heatmap
- Pairplot of important features
- Pie Charts showing Survival and Gender proportions

# Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook (`Titanic_EDA.ipynb`)
- PDF Report (`Task5.pdf`)
- Project Documentation (`README.md`)

# Dataset
- Dataset Used: [Titanic Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

#Final Outcome
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:
- Cleaning and preparing data
- Visualizing relationships between variables
- Drawing actionable insights from data
- Building a strong foundation for Machine Learning model preparation
